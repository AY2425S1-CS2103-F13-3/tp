# AB-3 User Guide

AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a  Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

Example:

![add schedule example](images/add-schedule_example.png)

- `add-schedule c/1 2 n/Dinner d/10-10-2024 t/1800`
- **Before**: no Dinner event at 10-10-2024 1800.
- **After**: Dinner event at 10-10-2024 1800 is added.

### Delete meeting from schedule

Delete events from user's schedule.

### Edit Meeting in Schedule

Edit the existing meeting within the schedule.

Format: `edit-schedule INDEX [n/NAME] [d/DATE] [t/TIME] [c/INDEX]...`
- `INDEX`: Refers to the schedule you want to edit. The index is based on the current schedule view and **must** be specified.
- `n/NAME` (optional): The new description or name of the meeting. If not provided, the name remains unchanged.
- `d/DATE` (optional): The new date of the meeting. Must be in the format `DD-MM-YYYY`. If not provided, the date remains unchanged.
- `t/TIME` (optional): The new time of the meeting. Must be in 24-hour format `hhmm`. If not provided, the time remains unchanged.
- `c/INDEX` (optional): Refers to the contact's index in the current address book view. You can specify multiple `c/INDEX` values:
    - If the contact is **already in** the meeting, specifying `c/INDEX` will **remove** the contact.
    - If the contact is **not in** the meeting, specifying `c/INDEX` will **add** the contact.
- At least one of `n/NAME`, `d/DATE`, `t/TIME`, or `c/INDEX` must be specified. If a field is not provided, the current value for that field remains unchanged.

Example:
- `edit-schedule 1 n/Dinner d/10-10-2024 t/1800 c/2 c/3 c/4`

- **Before**: Schedule 1 contains contacts `1, 2, 3`.
- **After**: Contacts `2` and `3` are removed (as they were already in the meeting), and contact `4` is added. The final list of contacts for the meeting is `1, 4`.

Notes:
- You must always specify the `INDEX` of the schedule to be edited.
- At least one other field (`n/NAME`, `d/DATE`, `t/TIME`, or `c/INDEX`) must be provided; otherwise, the command will not execute.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
